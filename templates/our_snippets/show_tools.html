    This is a list of tools from usegalaxy.eu and their resource
    requirements. Please type in names of the
    packages/libraries/tools you might use in your analysis, in
    order to recieve a rough summary of the Jupyter resources you
    might require. The list is comprehensive, but does not
    encompass all possible packages (e.g. Seurat is notably
    missing)
