These are system files to help with the automation and day to day
tasks of the server.




All the systemd files in this folder should be modified to suit the
jupyter virtual environment, paths, proxy machines, users, etc.

Then they should be copied in =/etc/systemd/system/= and then enabled.

The jupyterhub service file has a soft dependency on the docker_slice
and proxy-tunnel services, so they should automatically start when jupyter starts.

Docker needs one final piece of configuration to tell it what its parent control group is.

Change =/etc/docker/daemon.json= to:

#+begin_src js
  {
    "storage-driver": "overlay2",
    "cgroup-parent": "docker_limit.slice"
  }
#+end_src
