to the users, permitting the admin allows it.

* Quick Start

A full breakdown of the installation process can be read in the
[[./COMPLETE_GUIDE.org]], but if your OS is relatively modern (read: Arch,
not: Ubuntu):


1. Clone the following repositories into the following directories

   #+begin_src bash
     sudo mkdir -p /opt/jupyterhub
     sudo chown $(whoami): /opt/jupyterhub
     git clone --depth 1 https://gitlab.com/mtekman/jupyterhub-pharma253 -b main /opt/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-pharma
     git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/mtekman/jupyterhub/ -b sysmon /opt/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-metrics
   #+end_src

2. Generate a virtualenv of the Jupyterhub metrics repo and install it

   #+begin_src bash
     cd /opt/jupyterhub/jupyterhub-pharma
     python -m virtualenv venv_jupyter_metrics
     source venv_jupyter_metrics/bin/activate
     pip install ../jupyterhub-metrics
     pip install dockerspawner psutil configurable-http-proxy
   #+end_src

3. Configure Jupyter for your system

   Please read the "Jupyter Config file" section in the
   [[./COMPLETE_GUIDE.org]], as well as finding the docker subnet, and
   allowing it within the firewall.

4. Setup the SystemD and Docker Limits

   - First configure the files in the =systemd= directory, namely:
     - docker_slice: Set the correct CPUQuota and MemoryHigh limits to match your system
     - proxy-tunnel: Set the correct user, ssh port, proxy binding port, proxyuser, and proxydevice
     - jupyterhub: Set the PATH to the virtual environment we installed above

   - Then, copy over all systemd files to =/etc/systemd/system/=

   - Modify the =/etc/docker/daemon.json= file to:

     #+begin_src js
       {
           "storage-driver": "overlay2",
           "cgroup-parent": "docker_limit.slice"
       }
     #+end_src

5. Run JupyterHub

   #+begin_src bash
     sudo systemctl start jupyterhub
   #+end_src

   It should automatically spawn up the proxy, and docker limits by itself
